FastDist, a program for protein evolutionary distances fast computing

Please send bug reports, comments, etc., to guy.perriere[at]univ-lyon1.fr

Basic usage:

    fastdist <infile>

Where <infile> is a protein sequence alignment file in Fasta format. By default,
results are sent to the standard output as a distance matrix in Phylip format.
This matrix can be then used to compute a phylogenetic tree with any program
compatible with this format (eg, Neighbor or BioNJ).

Possible options:

    fastdist <infile> [-n <name>] [-m <model>] [-a <alpha>] [-e <0|1|2>]
    [-b <number>] [-s <number> [-t <number>] [-f] [-g] [-x]

Where:

    -n <name>      Name four output files (default: infile)
    -m <model>     Amino acid substitution model (default: PAM)
    -e <0|1|2>     Missing distances estimation method (default: 0)
    -a <alpha>     Gamma shape parameter (default: 2.25)
    -b <number>    Number of boostrap replicates (default: 0)
    -s <number>    Number used as seed for bootstrap replicates (default: 0)
    -t <number>    Number of threads (default: 1)
    -f             Amino acids equilibrium frequencies estimated from dataset
                   (otherwise: equilibrium frequencies taken from model)
    -g             Global gap removal (otherwise: pairwise gap removal)
    -x             One file per tree (otherwise: all generated trees are in the same file)

For the amino acid substitution models, possible values are PAM, JTT, WAG, LG,
Blo, Kim, Poi, Gam, Obs, Gap. Blo stands for BLOSUM62, Kim for the Kimura
approximation of PAM, Poi for Poisson, Gam for Gamma-corrected Poisson, Obs for
the observed divergence and Gap for the observed divergence with gap as a
supplementary character. Values for PAM and JTT exchangeabilities and
equilibrium frequencies are the ones from DCMut versions (Kosiol and Goldman,
2005).

The -f option is only useful when using the substitution models PAM, JTT, WAG, LG and BLOSUM62.

For the alpha parameter, this option is only useful when using the Gamma-
corrected Poisson distance (Gam). Following Nei and Zhang (2005), the default
value (alpha = 2.25) allows to approximate a PAM distance while a value of alpha
= 2.4 allows to approximate a JTT distance

The -s option is only useful when using bootstrap replicates. The number must be
an unsigned integer. Note that if 0 is chosen (the default) then the seed used
will be generated using the time in seconds since the Epoch (00:00:00 UTC,
January 1, 1970). 

For the missing distances estimation methods, possible values are 0 (no
estimation), 1 (estimation by the ultrametric inequality approach) and 2
(estimation by the additive procedure with the four points condition). Those
two methods are described in Makarenkov and Lapointe (2004).

The -t option is only available with HPC binaries (ie, those that have been
compiled with the OpenMP library).
